    The purpose of the model is to supply water to the farm without human presence whenever the farm is dry, and avoiding water wastage in irrigation process. This reduces the farmers effort in irrigating the land. It includes Arduino Mega, motor, relay, and sensors like soil moisture sensor, Humidity and temperature sensor. This system is highly efficient when compared with conventional approach.
